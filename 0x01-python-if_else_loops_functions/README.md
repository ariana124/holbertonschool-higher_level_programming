### Tasks
0. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable `number` is positive or negative.
1. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable `number`.
2. Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
3. Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet except `e` and `q`, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
4. Write a program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal.
5. Write a program that prints numbers from 0 to 99.
6. Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
7. Write a function that checks for lowercase character.
8. Write a function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.
9. Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.
10. Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.
11. Write a function that computes a to the power of b and return the value.
12. Write a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space.
    - For multiples of three print `Fizz` instead of the number and for multiples of five print `Buzz`.
    - For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print `FizzBuzz`.
13. Write a function that creates a copy of the string, removing the character at the position `n` (not the Python way, the “C array index”).
